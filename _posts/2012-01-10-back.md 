Writing your first post is terrifying process even more when english it's not your native. Thanks to [Lordalex](http://www.twitter.com/lordalexworks) for the corrections.I will do my best to share with you every regularly.

Last 2 weeks was quite busy for us, we relauch our website and I launch my personal landing page. For [Bolomichelin.com](http://bolomichelin.com/) has been built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com "jekyll") and hosted by [Github](http://pages.github.com "GitHub Pages"). It's low cost solution ,flexible and simple to setup.
