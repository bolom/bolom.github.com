I'll be honest, it's my first blog and I don't count my Tumbr post (deleted) or my [CoderWall tips](http://coderwall.com/bolomichelin "coderwall.com : Bolo Michelin's profile") with them I can sharing in a super-fast down and dirty way. 

Writing your first post is terrifying process even more when english it's not your native. Thanks to [Lordalex](http://www.twitter.com/lordalex) and [Christophe](http://www.twitter.com/christophe971) for the corrections. I will do my best to share with you every regularly.

Last 2 weeks were quite busy for us, we relauched our website and I launched my personal landing page. [Bolomichelin.com](http://bolomichelin.com/) has built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com "jekyll") and hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com "GitHub Pages"). It's low cost solution, flexible and simple to setup.
