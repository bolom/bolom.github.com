I am a developer for 10 years now. I discovered Flash Macromedia in year 2000 during my high school project: I had to animate a phonograph. I fell in love right away, knowing that my only limit was my imagination.

Thanks to you, Flash I've worked in several places in the world and for different prestigious clients.

Thanks to you, Flash I've built games, interactive kiosks, websites, mobile apps, photo galleries for blu ray player and lot of other things, i don't even remember.

Despite our good times, I'm sorry, but I donâ€™t agree with your recent choices. I don't like your new tools. I don't like your new philosophy. You're not the future anymore... but the past.

The straw that broke the camel's back ? Microsoft have just created [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org).

> TypeScript is a language for application-scale JavaScript development.
> TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript

Perhaps not by accident, TypeScript's type annotations are quite similar to those suggested for ECMAScript 4.

Wasn't it your job to do that ?


I may repeat myself but I want to be a part of the future and you're the past. You know, I have new friends now : Objective-c, HTML/CSS/JS, SDK kinnect, Ruby and ...
I wish you all the best but it's over between us.

Bolo
